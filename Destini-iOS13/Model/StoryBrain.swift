That's more annual electricity use than all of Finland, which is a country of 5.5 million people. That's about the same amount of electricity consumed in the state of Washington each year, and more than a third of electricity used for residential cooling in the US annually."

                answerExplenation: "Light pollution has negative impacts on plant and animal physiology. It can confuse the migratory patterns of animals, alter competitive interactions of animals, change predator-prey relations, and cause physiological harm. The rhythm of life is orchestrated by the natural diurnal patterns of light and dark; so disruption to these patterns impacts the ecological dynamics."

Almost 1,100 square miles burned in Colorado during 2020, including the three largest fires in state history. Lastly there is a significant economic damage as proven in the study of wildFires from 2018 which totaled $148.5 billion published in Nature Sustainability."
